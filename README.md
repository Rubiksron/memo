# Chore Bear
This is a todo app with 3 categories:
Groceries, Hardware, and Drugstore. A user can create an account and create all chores in the main page, or the user can look at an individual view of each category.  

Chore Bear uses Bcrypt to hash the users password and Postgres SQL to store the users data.

Attribution:
I use images from 'We Bare Bears' from the cartoon network. The main input and the sign-in page background are both their property, as well as the image in the main form where one would add chores.
